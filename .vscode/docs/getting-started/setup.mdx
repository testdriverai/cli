<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Node.js">
    Ensure you have Node.js (v16 or higher) installed.

    Check your Node.js version:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

    If not installed, download it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install NPM">
    **npm**: Comes with Node.js. Verify `npm` is installed:

    ```bash
    npm -v
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Your Test Runner" stepNumber={3}>
    In your project directory, run the interactive setup process:

    ```sh
    npx testdriverai@latest init
    ```

    TestDriver requires a runner to execute tests. You can use either a hosted sandbox or your own computer.

    - **TestDriver Sandbox** - Run tests in a ephemeral linux virtual machine. Recommended for ease of use, added privacy, and parallelization. Requires a TestDriver API key.
    - **Local Runner** - Run tests on your own computer. Recommended for working with existing user sessions, files, and applications. Requires additional setup.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Hosted Sandbox Setup">
        Running `init` in your project directory and choose "yes" for the sandbox option. This will prompt you for your API key.

        ```
        Beginning setup...
        ✔ Use TestDriver Sandbox Runners? (Recommended) … yes
        ? API KEY (from https://app.testdriver.ai/team) › ********
        ```

        This will write the `TD_API_KEY` values to `.env` file in your project directory.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Local Windows Setup">
        #### Install Python & Visual Studio build tools

        ```powershell
        choco install python visualstudio2022-workload-vctools -y
        ```

        #### Install Node.js

        You will also need Node.js if you don't have it yet.

        ```powershell
        choco install nodejs-lts --version="20.17.0"
        ```

        #### Set execution policy

        Open a new terminal with admin privileges and execute the following command :

        ```powershell
        Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
        ```

        This gives TestDriver the right to execute it's scripts and is only valid for the current user.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Local Mac Setup">
        #### Enable screen recording permissions

        TestDriver requires screen recording permissions to capture your screen during test execution.

        - Open **System Preferences \> Security & Privacy \> Privacy \> Screen Recording**.
        - Check the box next to your terminal application (for example, Terminal, iTerm2) to allow screen recording.

        This is required for TestDriver to capture your screen during test execution.

        #### Enable accessibility permissions

        - Open **System Preferences \> Security & Privacy \> Privacy \> Accessibility**.
        - Check the box next to your terminal application (for example, Terminal, iTerm2) to allow accessibility features.

        This is required for TestDriver to interact with your applications during test execution.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run TestDriver in Interactive Mode" stepNumber={4}>
    Start TestDriver in interactive mode.

    ```bash
    npx testdriverai@latest
    ```

    You should see a prompt like this:

    ```bash
    Howdy! I'm TestDriver v4.2.26
    ```
