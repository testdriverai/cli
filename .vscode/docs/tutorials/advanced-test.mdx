# Advanced test tutorial

Welcome to the Advanced Test Tutorial. In this guide, we will explore advanced testing techniques and features available in TestDriver. This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of TestDriver and its functionalities.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have completed the basic TestDriver tutorial and have the following:

- TestDriver installed and configured.
- A sample project to test.

## Advanced features overview

TestDriver provides several advanced features to enhance your testing capabilities:

1. **Custom Assertions**: Create custom assertions to validate specific conditions.
2. **Parameterized Tests**: Run tests with different sets of input data.
3. **Test Hooks**: Use hooks to execute code before or after tests.
4. **Parallel Execution**: Speed up testing by running tests in parallel.

## Step-by-step guide

### Step 1: Setting up custom assertions

Custom assertions allow you to define specific conditions for your tests. Here's an example:

```python
def assert_custom_condition(value):
    assert value > 0, "Value must be greater than 0"
```

### Step 2: Using parameterized tests

Parameterized tests enable you to test multiple scenarios with different inputs. Example:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected", [(1, True), (0, False)])
def test_is_positive(input, expected):
    assert (input > 0) == expected
```

### Step 3: Implementing test hooks

Test hooks let you execute code before or after tests. Example:

```python
def setup_function():
    print("Setting up test environment")

def teardown_function():
    print("Cleaning up test environment")
```

### Step 4: Running tests in parallel

Parallel execution can be achieved using pytest-xdist. Install it with:

```bash
pip install pytest-xdist
```

Run tests in parallel using:

```bash
pytest -n 4
```

## Conclusion

By leveraging these advanced features, you can create more robust and efficient tests for your projects. Experiment with these techniques to find the best fit for your testing needs.

Happy testing!
