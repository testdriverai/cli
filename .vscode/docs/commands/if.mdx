## Description
The `if` command is used to conditionally execute a set of commands based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. If the condition is true, the commands in the `then` block are executed. Otherwise, the commands in the `else` block are executed.

## Arguments
| Argument    | Type              | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `condition` | `string`          | The condition to evaluate.                                                 |
| `then`      | `list of commands`| The commands to run if the condition is true.                              |
| `else`      | `list of commands`| The commands to run if the condition is false.                             |

## Example usage
```yaml
command: if
condition: the text "Accept Cookies" is visible
then:
  - command: hover-text
    text: Accept Cookies
    description: cookie banner button
    action: click
else:
  - command: hover-text
    text: Sign Up
    description: link in the header
    action: click
```

## Protips
- Ensure the `condition` is clearly defined and evaluates correctly to avoid unexpected behavior.
- Use descriptive `then` and `else` blocks to handle both outcomes effectively.
- Combine the `if` command with other commands like `hover-text` or `focus-application` to create dynamic workflows.

## Gotchas
- If the `condition` is invalid or can't be evaluated, the command will fail.
- Ensure all commands in the `then` and `else` blocks are valid and properly formatted.

## Notes
- The `if` command is useful for creating conditional logic in your tests, allowing for more dynamic and flexible workflows.
- Both the `then` and `else` blocks are optional, but at least one must be provided.
