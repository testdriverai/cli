## Description
The `wait-for-text` command waits until the specified text is detected on the screen. This is useful for ensuring that textual elements are present before proceeding with the next steps in a test.

## Arguments
| Argument  | Type     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `text`    | `string` | The text to find on the screen.                                             |
| `timeout` | `number` | (Optional) The duration in milliseconds to wait for the text to appear. Default is `5000`. |
| `method`  | `enum`   | (Optional) The matching algorithm to use. Possible values are `ai` (default) and `turbo`. |

## Example usage
```yaml
command: wait-for-text
text: Copyright 2024
timeout: 5000
```

## Protips
- Use unique and specific text to improve detection accuracy.
- Choose the appropriate `method` for your use case:
  - `ai`: More robust for complex or ambiguous text matching (default).
  - `turbo`: Faster and more efficient for simpler scenarios.
- Adjust the `timeout` value based on the expected load time of the text to avoid unnecessary delays.

## Gotchas
- If the text doesn't appear within the specified `timeout`, the command will fail.
- Ensure the text matches exactly, as variations in font size, style, or screen resolution may affect detection accuracy.

## Notes
- The `wait-for-text` command is ideal for synchronizing tests with textual elements that may take time to load.
- This command supports flexible matching algorithms to accommodate different scenarios.
