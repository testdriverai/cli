TestDriver isn't just a computer-use agent, it's an entire AI-native workflow for creating end-to-end tests. Follow these steps to set up your environment and get started with TestDriver.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a TestDriver Account">
    Because TestDriver is powered by agentic users, a **free** account is required to access:

    - Dedicated Virtual Machines (VMs) for running agents
    - TestDriver AI \+ Vision models
    - Community support

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your environment">
      
    Copy your API key from [the TestDriver dashboard](https://app.testdriver.ai/team), and set it as an environment variable.
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
        ```bash Export an environment variable on macOS or Linux systems
        export TD_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows">
      ```powershell Export an environment variable in PowerShell
      setx TD_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
      ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run an example test">
      
    Download the TestDriver GitHub repository and run the web example test.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/testdriverai/cli testdriverai
    cd testdriverai/testdriver/examples/web
    npx testdriverai@beta run example.yaml --write --heal --persist
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Exploratory mode">
    
    TestDriver is running an "exploratory" test on a virtual machine.

    TestDriver tests are written in YAML, a human-readable data format. The `example.yaml` file contains a series of steps that the agent will execute.

    ```yaml testdriver/test.yaml
    steps:
        - prompt: log in
        - prompt: add an item to the cart
        - prompt: click on the cart icon
        - prompt: complete checkout
    ```

    Each step has a `prompt` that describes what the agent should do. The agent will use the prompt to generate [commands](/commands) that make the tests faster and more reliable the next time you run the test.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your first test">

    Exploratory mode is triggered whenever a `step` contains no `commands`.

    ```yaml
      version: 5.7.7
      session: 682f6071811bd5a322c0e6dd
      steps:
      - prompt: focus chrome
        commands:
        - command: focus-application
          name: Google Chrome
      - prompt: enter a username
        commands:
        - command: hover-text
          text: Username
          description: username input field
          action: click
        - command: type
          text: standard_user
      - prompt: enter a password
        commands:
        - command: hover-text
          text: Password
          description: password input field
          action: click
        - command: type
          text: secret_password
      ```

      The `--write` command tells the agent to save the generated commands to the test file, and the `--heal` command gives the agent permission to recover if something goes wrong.
