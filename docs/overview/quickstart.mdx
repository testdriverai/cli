TestDriver isn't just a computer-use agent, it's an entire AI-native workflow for creating end-to-end tests. Follow these steps to set up your environment and get started with TestDriver.


<Steps>
<Step title="Set Up TestDriver">

  <AccordionGroup>

  
  <Accordion title="Install the CLI">

    Ensure you have Node.js (v16 or higher) installed. Then, install the TestDriver CLI globally using `npm`:

    ```bash
    npm install -g testdriverai
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Initialize your project">

    Run `testdriverai init` in your project directory. This will launch an interactive setup process.

    ```bash
    testdriverai init
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configure test runner">

    Running `testdriverai init` will prompt you to set up your test runner; a target computer to run tests on. You can use either a hosted sandbox or your own computer.

    - **Hosted Runners** - Run tests in a ephemeral linux virtual machine. Recommended for ease of use, added privacy, and parallelization. Requires a TestDriver API key.
    - **Local Runner** - Run tests on your own computer. Recommended for working with existing user sessions, files, and applications. Requires additional setup.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Hosted Runners (Recommended)">

        Run `testdriverai init` in your project directory and choose "yes" for the sandbox option. This will prompt you for your API key.

        ```
        Beginning setup...
        ✔ Use TestDriver Sandbox Runners? (Recommended) … yes
        ? API KEY (from https://app.testdriver.ai/team) › ********
        ```

        This will write the `TD_VM=true` and `TD_API_KEY` values to `.env` file in your project directory. 

      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows">

        Using your own computer as a test runner requires additional prerequisites. Follow the AccordionGroup below to set up your local environment.

        #### Install Python & Visual Studio Build Tools

        ```powershell
        choco install python visualstudio2022-workload-vctools -y
        ```

        #### Install NodeJS

        You will also need NodeJS if you don't have it yet.

        ```powershell
        choco install nodejs-lts --version="20.17.0"
        ```

        #### Set Execution Policy

        Open a new terminal with admin privileges and execute the following command : 
        ```powershell
        Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
        ```
      
        This gives TestDriver the right to execute it's scripts and is only valid for the current user. 
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Mac">

        Using your own computer as a test runner requires additional permissions. Follow the steps below to set up your local environment.

        #### Enable Screen Recording Permissions
        
        TestDriver requires screen recording permissions to capture your screen during test execution.

        - Open **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Screen Recording**.
        - Check the box next to your terminal application (e.g., Terminal, iTerm2) to allow screen recording.
        
        This is required for TestDriver to capture your screen during test execution.
        
        #### Enable Accessibility Permissions
        
        - Open **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility**.
        - Check the box next to your terminal application (e.g., Terminal, iTerm2) to allow accessibility features.

        This is required for TestDriver to interact with your applications during test execution.

</Step>

<Step title="Create your first test">

Use the `/explore` command to supply test steps to the TestDriver agent. TestDriver will look at the screen and generate a test steps based on your input.  

```
> Open Google Chrome and search for "testdriverai"
```

TestDriver will generate and run test steps. See the [YAML Reference](/commands/assert). 

```yaml
- command: focus-application
  name: Google Chrome
- command: hover-text
  text: Search Google or type a URL
  description: main search bar
  action: click
- command: type
  text: testdriverai
- command: press-keys
  keys: [enter]
```

Test steps are saved in the current working YAML file. 

<Tip>Use Control + C in the CLI or the square "stop" button in the extension to stop test execution.</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Running tests">

Once saved, you can run your test file anytime. Click the "Run" button in the extension or use the CLI command:

```bash
testdriverai run testdriver/your_test.yml
```

Running tests is about twice as fast as creating them, as the AI doesn't need to interpret your input.

</Step>

<Step title="Generate self-driving tests">
TestDriver can also generate tests without any input! Instead, it will suggest test steps based on what it sees on the screen.

<Step title="Deploy to CI/CD">

  The `testdriverai init` command automatically sets up a GitHub Action workflow for you. Any test files found in the `testdriver` directory will run on every push to the main branch.
