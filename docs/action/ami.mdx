<Tip>
  This guide is specifically for **Enterprise Plan customers** who have access
  to the shared TestDriver AMI. If you are on a different plan, please contact
  your account manager for more information.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send Us Your AWS Account ID">
    To begin, send your **12-digit AWS account ID** to your **TestDriver account manager**. We'll share the AMI directly with your AWS account using [Amazon's explicit AMI sharing process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/sharingamis-explicit.html).
  </Step>

<Step title="Wait for Confirmation">
  Your account manager will notify you when the AMI has been shared with your
  account. You will receive the **AMI ID** (e.g., `ami-0abcd1234efgh5678`).
</Step>

  <Step title="Launch and Connect with RDP">
    Once you have the AMI ID, launch an EC2 instance and connect via RDP:

    1. Ensure your **security group allows RDP (TCP port 3389)**.
    2. In the EC2 Console, select your instance ‚Üí **Connect > RDP Client**.
    3. Download the `.rdp` file or copy the public IP to open manually in your RDP client.
    4. Retrieve the **Administrator password** via the EC2 console and your key pair.

    <Note>You will access a full Windows desktop where TestDriver is pre-installed and ready for customization.</Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize the Instance">
    Inside the Windows desktop environment:

    1. **Download and install your application** using a browser, Git, PowerShell, or other tools.
    2. Add any required system configuration, environment variables, or startup scripts.
    3. Verify the full setup works correctly in the sandbox.

    Common use cases:
    - Pull from GitHub or your artifact store
    - Configure your app with test credentials or environment variables
    - Enable logging or install monitoring tools

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your Custom AMI">
    Once your customizations are complete, create an AMI from your instance:

    1. In the EC2 Console, select your customized instance.
    2. Go to **Actions** ‚Üí **Image and templates** ‚Üí **Create image**.
    3. Provide a descriptive **Image name** and **Description**.
    4. Click **Create image** to start the AMI creation process.
    5. Wait for the AMI status to change from "pending" to "available".

    <Note>The AMI creation process may take several minutes depending on the instance size and customizations.</Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Share Your AMI and Use with TestDriver CLI">
    After creating your custom AMI:

    1. **Share the AMI ID** with your **TestDriver account manager** so we can launch it in our infrastructure. Follow [Amazon's explicit AMI sharing process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/sharingamis-explicit.html) if needed.
    2. Once confirmed, you can reference the AMI directly from your machine using the TestDriver CLI:

    ```bash
    testdriverai --sandbox-ami=ami-0abcd1234efgh5678
    ```

    This instructs the CLI to launch a sandbox using **your customized AMI**, enabling test execution in your environment.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## üîê Best Practices & Security

- Always use **strong RDP passwords** and keep your key pairs secure.
- Apply **Windows Updates** to stay current with patches.
- Use **IAM roles with least privilege** to access other AWS resources.
- Consider **encrypting your volumes and AMI** if handling sensitive data.
