# macOS Automation Limitations

macOS includes several system-level security features that affect how synthetic input‚Äîlike mouse clicks and keyboard presses generated by automation tools‚Äîis interpreted. If you're using tools like `robot.js` for test automation, it's important to understand which applications and interactions may be blocked or ignored by the system.

## üîê System-Level Protected Apps

Some macOS applications are **heavily protected** by System Integrity Protection (SIP) and will **not respond to synthetic input**, even if Accessibility permissions are granted.

Examples include:

- **Finder**
- **System Settings / System Preferences**
- **Dock**
- **Menu Bar**
- **Login Window**
- **Launchpad**
- **Installer**
- **File Open / Save Dialogs**

These apps typically ignore input generated by tools like `robot.js` or even AppleScript unless scripted via system-sanctioned methods.

Synthetic double-clicks often fail in Finder, even when the correct timing and coordinates are used.

## üõ°Ô∏è TCC-Protected Applications

Apps protected by Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) **can be automated** if the right permissions are granted.

To enable automation for these apps:

1. Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**
2. Add and check the app or terminal running your automation (e.g., Terminal, iTerm, VS Code).
3. You may also need to grant:
   - **Input Monitoring**
   - **Screen Recording**
   - **Full Disk Access**

These permissions allow tools like `robot.js` to simulate clicks, keystrokes, and screen interactions in:

- **Google Chrome**
- **Safari**
- **Slack**
- **Mail**
- **Calendar**
- **Notes**
- **VS Code**
- **Xcode**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Best Targets for UI Automation

For reliable automation, use `robot.js` or TestDriver with:

- Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge)
- Electron apps (Slack, Discord)
- Most third-party GUI apps
- Terminal emulators

These apps typically respect synthetic input when appropriate permissions are granted.

## üö´ Actions That Can't Be Automated

macOS enforces strict security policies on certain sensitive UI elements. Automation is **not possible** for:

- Login screen interactions
- Security permission prompts (e.g., ‚ÄúAllow Screen Recording‚Äù)
- Password input in secure dialogs
- Force Quit window
- Crash reporter popups

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- Always **grant Accessibility permissions** to the app or terminal running `robot.js`.
- Use **AppleScript** for system apps like Finder or System Settings.
- For GUI testing, prefer apps that are not protected by SIP.
- Consider using native tools like **XCUITest** or **Appium** for native macOS apps.
