import YmlWarning from "/snippets/yml-warning.mdx";

Test scripts are written in YAML format, making them easy to read and modify manually if you need to.

## Locate the Test File

TestDriver test files are typically stored in the `testdriver/` directory of your project. The default file is `testdriver/testdriver.yaml`.

### Open the Test File

Use your preferred text editor or IDE (for example, Visual Studio Code) to open the YAML file.

### YAML Structure

Each test file consists of:

- **Version**: Specifies the TestDriver version.
- **Session**: A unique identifier for the test session.
- **Steps**: A list of prompts and commands to execute.

```yaml testfile.yaml
version: 4.2.18
session: abc1234
steps:
  - prompt: Open Google Chrome and navigate to Airbnb
    commands:
      - command: focus-application
        name: Google Chrome
      - command: hover-text
        text: Search Google or type a URL
        description: main google search
        action: click
      - command: type
        text: airbnb.com
      - command: press-keys
        keys: [enter]
```

<Tip>
  The `version` captured when you generate a test file is the version of
  TestDriver you used, and isn't used when running the test. This doesn't affect
  your ability to use newer versions of TestDriver on existing test files nor do
  these need to be updated when migrating to a new version.
</Tip>

### Modify the test steps

You can add, edit, or remove steps as needed. Each step contains:

- **Prompt**: A description of the action.
- **Commands**: The specific actions to perform.

#### Example edits:

- **Add a Wait Command**:

  ```yaml
  - command: wait
    timeout: 3000
  ```

- **Change the URL**:
  Update the `text` field in the `type` command:

  ```yaml
  - command: type
    text: booking.com
  ```

### Validate the YAML syntax

Ensure the YAML file is properly formatted:

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces recommended).
- Avoid trailing spaces or tabs.
- Validate the file using a YAML linter if needed.

### Test the changes

Run the updated test to verify it works as expected:

```bash
npx testdriverai@latest run path/to/test.yaml
```
