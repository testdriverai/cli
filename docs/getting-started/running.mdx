Run tests using previously created test scripts. This command replays the steps defined in the YAML file, performing each action sequentially.

You can run a test script by specifying the file path in the terminal or interactively within the TestDriver CLI.

### Example in terminal

```bash
npx testdriverai@latest run path/to/test.yaml
```

This will execute the test script located at `path/to/test.yaml`. If the test passes, the command will exit with a status code of `0`. If it fails, the command will exit with a status code of `1`.

### Interactive mode

To run a test interactively:

1. Launch the TestDriver CLI:

```bash
npx testdriverai@latest
```

2. At the `>` prompt, type:

```bash
/run path/to/test.yaml
```

## Notes

- Ensure the YAML file is valid and follows the TestDriver specification.
- The default file path is `testdriver/testdriver.yaml` if no file is specified.
