This guide explains how to set up a basic GitHub Actions workflow to run tests using **TestDriver**.

## Prerequisites

1. **TestDriver API Key**: Obtain your API key from TestDriver and store it as a GitHub secret (for example, `TD_API_KEY`).
2. **Test Files**: Ensure your test files are saved in the `testdriver/` directory of your repository.

## Create a GitHub Actions workflow

1. Create a new file in your repository: `.github/workflows/testdriver.yaml`.
2. Add the following workflow configuration:

### Example workflow

```yaml .github/workflows/testdriver.yaml [expandable]
name: TestDriver / Run / Regressions

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 13 * * *'  # Every day at 1 PM UTC (adjust if needed for timezone)

permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read
  statuses: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  gather-test-files:
    name: Setup Test Matrix (./testdriver/*.yaml)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      test_files: ${{ steps.test_list.outputs.files }}
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.ref }}
      - name: Find all test files and extract filenames
        id: test_list
        run: |
          FILES=$(ls ./testdriver/*.yaml)
          FILENAMES=$(basename -a $FILES)
          FILES_JSON=$(echo "$FILENAMES" | jq -R -s -c 'split("\n")[:-1]')
          echo "::set-output name=files::$FILES_JSON"

  test:
    needs: gather-test-files
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        test: ${{ fromJson(needs.gather-test-files.outputs.test_files) }}
        os: ['linux', 'windows']
      fail-fast: false
    name: ${{ matrix.test }} (${{ matrix.os }})
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.ref }}

      - name: Display filename being tested
        run: echo "Running job for file: ${{ matrix.test }} on ${{ matrix.os }}"

      - uses: testdriverai/action@main
        with:
          key: ${{ secrets.TD_API_KEY }}
          os: ${{ matrix.os }}
          version: "5.2.3"
          prompt: 1. /run testdriver/${{ matrix.test }}
          prerun: |
            cd $env:TEMP
            npm init -y
            npm install dashcam-chrome
            Start-Process "C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe" -ArgumentList "--start-maximized", "--load-extension=$(pwd)/node_modules/dashcam-chrome/build", "${{ env.TD_WEBSITE }}"
            exit
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          FORCE_COLOR: "3"
```

## Trigger the workflow

1. Push changes to the `main` branch or open a pull request.
2. Alternatively, manually trigger the workflow from the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.

## View results

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Select the workflow run to view the test results.

# Debugging tests
TestDriver provides a powerful debugging interface through its **app.TestDriver** platform (formerly Dashcam). This interface allows you to analyze test runs, identify failures, and optimize your test suite with detailed visual and textual feedback.

### 1. Step-by-step execution logs
- View each step of the test execution, including:
  - The **action performed** (for example, clicking a button, typing text).
  - The **expected outcome** (for example, verifying a specific element is visible).
  - The **result** (pass, fail, or skipped).
- Logs provide detailed context for each step, making it easier to pinpoint where and why a test failed.

### 2. Visual feedback
- **Screenshots**: See what the application looked like at each step of the test.
- **GIF Previews**: Watch a replay of the entire test execution to understand the flow and identify UI issues.
- **Highlighting**: Elements interacted with during the test are highlighted in screenshots, helping you verify that the correct elements were targeted.

### 3. Error details
- For failed steps, app.TestDriver provides:
  - **Error messages**: Detailed descriptions of what went wrong (for example, "Element not found").
  - **Stack traces**: For advanced debugging of backend or script-related issues.
  - **Suggestions**: Recommendations for fixing common issues, such as adjusting prompts or improving element descriptions.

### 4. Test history
- Access the history of test runs to:
  - Compare results across different builds or environments.
  - Identify flaky tests by analyzing patterns in failures.
  - Track improvements or regressions over time.

### 5. Environment context
- View the environment details for each test run, including:
  - Operating system and browser version.
  - Screen resolution and viewport size.
  - Network conditions (if applicable).

### 6. Collaboration tools
- Share test results with your team by generating a shareable link.
- Add comments or annotations to specific steps to facilitate discussions and debugging.
