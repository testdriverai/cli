The TestDriver interactive CLI allows you to create, refine, and execute tests dynamically using natural language commands. Here's how to get started.

### Prepare your environment

Before we get started, let's set up your machine to collaborate with TestDriver.

#### Displays

TestDriver isn't like any framework you've used before. TestDriver makes decisions based on what it can see on your display!

<Tip>TestDriver only knows about what it can see on your primary display!</Tip>

When you enter commands into TestDriver, the current window will minimize and the `focus-window` command will bring Chrome or other applications to the foreground. 

For now, set up your environment with a browser window and your terminal side by side like so:

<Frame caption="Left or right, it doesn't matter!">
<img height="200" src="/images/content/side-by-side.png" />
</Frame>

#### Application state

The application you want to test should be visible before you run the testdriverai command. 

For our example, make a new incognito window in Chrome and load our test webpage:

```
https://testdriverai.github.io/example-react-todo/
```

<Tip>Make sure to reset your application state before running every test!</Tip>

### Launch interactive mode

Run the following command to launch the TestDriver interactive mode:

```bash
testdriverai
```
You'll see a prompt (`>`) where you can enter commands.

### Write tests using natural language

Simply describe what you want to test in plain English. For example:

```
> click sign up 
```

TestDriver will analyze your screen, interpret your instruction, and generate a test script to achieve the goal. It can see your UI, control the mouse and keyboard, and automate complex workflowsâ€”all through simple commands.

```yaml
thinking...

To accomplish the goal of clicking "Sign Up," we need to
focus on the Google Chrome application and then click on
the "Sign Up" button.

Here are the steps:

1. Focus the Google Chrome application.
2. Click on the "Sign Up" button.

commands:
  - command: focus-application
    name: Google Chrome
  - command: hover-text
    text: Sign Up
    description: button in the header
    action: click

command='focus-application' name='Google Chrome'
command='hover-text' text='Sign Up' description='button in the header' action='click'
```

### 4. Refine your test

If something doesn't work as intended:

- Use `/undo` to remove the last step:
  ```
  > /undo
  ```

Modify your prompt or add new steps to refine the test.

### 5. Save your test

Once you're satisfied with the test, save it to a YAML file:

```
> /save
```

This generates a reusable YAML file (for example, `testdriver.yaml`) with all the steps.
