## Description
The `remember` command is used to save a variable for later use. This is useful for storing values that you want to reference in subsequent commands or steps, especially for things that are dynamic or change frequently from run to run.

**The `remember` command is only availble form `v5.7.0` and later.**

## Arguments
| Argument | Type                | Description                                                                 |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `output`   | string | the variable name you will use to recall the value later. |
| `description`   | string | A prompt describing the value you want to store. |

## Example usage
```yaml
- command: remember
  output: my_variable
  description: The date value shown to the right or 'Order Date'
```
## Protips
- Use the output later with this syntax `${OUTPUT.my_variable}`.
- The `remember` command does not persist variables across different test runs. If you need to store values for later use in different test runs, consider using external storage solutions or environment variables.
- For now, the `remember` command only supports string values. If you need to store complex data types, you may use `remember` multiple times for the values. This may change in a later version.

## Gotchas
- The `remeember` command is only available from `v5.7.0` and later.
- Ensure the variable name is unique to avoid overwriting existing variables.
- The variable name is case-sensitive, so `my_variable` and `My_Variable` would be treated as different variables.

## Notes
- The `remember` command is ideal for storing values that are generated during the test run, such as timestamps, IDs, the text value of a link you might click later, or any other dynamic data.
