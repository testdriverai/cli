## Description
The `wait` command pauses the execution of the script for a specified number of milliseconds before continuing. This is useful for adding delays between commands or waiting for certain conditions to stabilize.

## Arguments
| Argument  | Type     | Description                              |
|-----------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| `timeout` | `number` | The duration in milliseconds to wait.    |

## Example usage
```yaml
command: wait
timeout: 5000
```

## Protips
- Use the `wait` command to handle timing issues, such as waiting for animations to complete or elements to load.
- Avoid using excessively long timeouts to keep tests efficient.

## Gotchas
- Overusing the `wait` command can slow down test execution. Use it only when necessary.
- Ensure the timeout value is appropriate for the scenario to avoid unnecessary delays.

## Notes
- The `wait` command is ideal for introducing controlled pauses in your test scripts.
- This command is supported across all platforms for consistent behavior.
