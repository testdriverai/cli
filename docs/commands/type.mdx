## Description
The `type` command is used to simulate typing a string using keyboard emulation. This is useful for entering text into input fields or performing text-based interactions.

## Arguments
| Argument | Type     | Description                     |
|---------|----------|---------------------------------|
| `text`  | `string` | The text string to type.        |

## Example usage
```yaml
command: type
text: Hello World
```

## Protips
- Use this command to input text into fields, such as search bars or forms.
- Ensure the target application or input field is in focus before using the `type` command to avoid unexpected behavior.

## Gotchas
- If the input field isn't active or in focus, the text may not be typed correctly.
- Special characters in the `text` string may require additional handling depending on the application.

## Notes
- The `type` command is ideal for automating text input in tests.
- This command supports cross-platform compatibility for consistent behavior across operating systems.
