## Description

The `scroll-until-text` command is used to scroll the screen in a specified direction until the specified text is found. This is useful for navigating to elements that aren't initially visible on the screen.

## Arguments

| Argument    | Type     | Description                                                                                     |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`      | `string` | The text to find on the screen. Longer and unique are better. Note this is **case sensitive**   |
| `direction` | `string` | The direction to scroll. Available directions are: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`.               |
| `distance`  | `number` | (Optional) The maximum number of pixels to scroll before giving up. Default is `300`.           |
| `method`    | `enum`   | (Optional) The matching algorithm to use. Possible values are `keyboard` (default) and `mouse`. |

## Example usage

```yaml
command: scroll-until-text
text: Sign Up
direction: down
method: keyboard
distance: 500
```

## Protips

- Use unique and specific text to improve detection accuracy.
  - Adjust the `distance` value to control how far the command scrolls before giving up.
  - If you don't specify a `distance`, the command will scroll 300 pixels at a time, giving up after 5 attempts.

## Gotchas

- If the text can't be located within the specified `distance`, the command will fail.
- Ensure the text is visible and matches exactly, as variations in font size, style, or screen resolution may affect detection accuracy.
- Note that `text` is case-sensitive, so **Sign Up** and **sign up** would be treated as different strings.

## Notes

- The `scroll-until-text` command is ideal for navigating to elements that are off-screen and can't be located using other commands.
- This command supports both vertical and horizontal scrolling for flexible navigation.
