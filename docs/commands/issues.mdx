## Known issues

### Image description matches

TestDriver may not accurately match image descriptions in certain cases. This can lead to unexpected behavior when using the `hover-image` command. For example, if you specify a description that's too generic or similar to other images on the screen, TestDriver may not be able to identify the correct image to interact with. To improve accuracy, use specific and unique descriptions for images.

### Text substrings

TestDriver may not accurately match text substrings in certain cases. This can lead to unexpected behavior when using the `hover-text` command.
