# Command: `scroll`

## Description
The `scroll` command is used to scroll the screen in a specified direction using the mouse wheel. This is useful for navigating through content that extends beyond the visible area.

## Arguments
| Argument    | Type     | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `direction` | `string` | The direction to scroll. Available directions are: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`. |
| `amount`    | `number` | (Optional) Pixels to scroll. If not specified, a default amount is used. |

## Example usage
```yaml
command: scroll
direction: down
amount: 100
```

## Protips
- Use precise `amount` values to control the scrolling distance for better accuracy in your tests.
- Combine the `scroll` command with other commands like `hover-text` or `match-image` to interact with elements that are initially off-screen.

## Gotchas
- Scrolling too far may cause elements to move out of view. Adjust the `amount` value as needed.
- Ensure the application or browser window is in focus when using this command to avoid unexpected behavior.

## Notes
- The `scroll` command is ideal for navigating through long pages or lists during automated tests.
- This command supports both vertical and horizontal scrolling for flexible navigation.
