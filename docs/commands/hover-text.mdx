## Description
The `hover-text` command is used to locate text on the screen based on a description and perform an action on it. This can include hovering, clicking, right-clicking, or double-clicking the text.

## Arguments
| Argument      | Type     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `text`        | `string` | The text to find on the screen. Longer and unique is better.     |
| `description` | `string` | A description of the text and what it represents. The actual text itself shouldn't be included here. |
| `action`      | `string` | The action to take when the text is found. Available actions are: `click`, `right-click`, `double-click`, `hover`. |
| `method`      | `enum`   | The matching algorithm to use. Possible values are `turbo` (default) and `ai`. |

## Example usage
```yaml
command: hover-text
text: Sign Up
description: link in the header
action: click
```

## Protips
- Use unique and specific text to improve detection accuracy.
- Choose the appropriate `method` for your use case:
  - `turbo`: Faster and more efficient for most scenarios.
  - `ai`: More robust for complex or ambiguous text matching.
- Ensure the action specified matches the intended interaction with the text.

## Gotchas
- If the text can't be located, the command will fail. Ensure the text is visible on the screen and matches exactly.
- Variations in font size, style, or screen resolution may affect detection accuracy.

## Notes
- The `hover-text` command is ideal for interacting with textual elements that can't be identified using other selectors.
- Supported actions allow flexibility in how the text is interacted with during the test.
