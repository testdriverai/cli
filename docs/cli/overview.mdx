The `testdriverai` CLI is the primary interface for running, managing, and debugging TestDriver scripts. It provides commands to execute tests, validate configurations, and interact with the TestDriver framework.

```bash
npx testdriverai@latest <command> [options]
```

| `run`      | Executes a TestDriver script.                                  |
| `validate` | Validates the syntax and structure of a TestDriver script.     |
| `init`     | Initializes a new TestDriver project in the current directory. |
| `version`  | Displays the current version of the TestDriver CLI.            |
| `help`     | Displays help information for the CLI or a specific command.   |

## Available Flags

| Command         | Description                                                                                |

## Example usage

### Running a test script

```bash
npx testdriverai@latest run path/to/testdriver.yaml
```

This command runs the specified TestDriver script, executing all steps defined in the file.

### Validating a script

```bash
npx testdriverai@latest validate path/to/testdriver.yaml
```

This command checks the syntax and structure of the script to ensure it's valid before execution.

### Initializing a new project

```bash
npx testdriverai@latest init
```

This command sets up a new TestDriver project in the current directory, creating the necessary folder structure and configuration files.

### Checking the version

```bash
npx testdriverai@latest version
```

This command displays the installed version of the TestDriver CLI.

### Getting help

```bash
npx testdriverai@latest help
```

This command displays general help information. To get help for a specific command, use:

```bash
npx testdriverai@latest help <command>
```

## Protips

- Use `validate` before running a script to catch errors early.
- Combine `run` with CI/CD pipelines to automate test execution.
- Use the `--debug` flag with `run` to enable detailed logging for troubleshooting.

<Info>
  Running `init` will create a blank `testdriver.yaml` file in the current
  directory. You can then edit this file to define your test steps.

## Notes

- The `testdriverai` CLI is cross-platform and works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- Ensure you have the required dependencies installed and configured before running scripts.
- For more advanced usage, refer to the official TestDriver documentation.
