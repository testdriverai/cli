## Description
The `/save` command saves the current state of the test script to a file. This command generates a YAML file containing the history of executed commands and tasks, allowing you to reuse or modify the test script later.

## Usage
```bash
/save
```

## Example usage
```bash
testdriverai
> /save

  saving...

  Current test script:

  version: 4.0.0
  steps:
    - prompt: navigate to fiber.google.com
      commands:
        - command: focus-application
          name: Google Chrome
        - command: hover-text
          text: Search Google or type a URL
          description: main google search
          action: click
        - command: type
          text: fiber.google.com
        - command: press-keys
          keys:
            - enter
```

## Behavior
- The `/save` command generates a YAML file with the current test script, including all executed steps and commands.
- The file can be used as a reusable test file for future executions.

## Protips
- Use `/save` frequently during interactive sessions to preserve your progress and avoid losing work.
- Combine `/save` with `/run` to quickly test and iterate on your scripts.

## Gotchas
- Ensure you have write permissions in the directory where the file will be saved.
- The saved script reflects the current state of the session. Any unexecuted commands won't be included.

## Notes
- The `/save` command is ideal for creating reusable test scripts from interactive sessions.
- Use this command to document and share your test workflows with your team.
