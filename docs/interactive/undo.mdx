## Description
The `/undo` command removes the last generated command or step from the current test script. This is useful for quickly correcting mistakes or removing unintended actions during an interactive session.

## Usage
```bash
/undo
```

## Behavior
- The `/undo` command removes the most recently added command or step from the test script.
- You can call `/undo` multiple times to remove multiple commands or steps.

## Example usage

### Before `/undo`
```yaml
- step: 
    - command: scroll-until-text
      text: Add to cart
- step: 
    - command: hover-text
      text: Add to cart
      action: click
```

### After `/undo`
```yaml
- step: 
    - command: scroll-until-text
      text: Add to cart
```

## Protips
- Use `/undo` immediately after generating a command to quickly fix mistakes or refine your test script.
- Combine `/undo` with `/save` to iteratively build and refine your test scripts.

## Gotchas
- The `/undo` command only removes the last generated command or step. If you need to undo multiple actions, call `/undo` repeatedly.
- Once a session is closed, you can't undo previously saved commands.

## Notes
- The `/undo` command is ideal for interactive sessions where you are experimenting with test generation.
- This command helps maintain a clean and accurate test script by allowing quick corrections.
