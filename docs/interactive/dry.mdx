## Description

The `/dry` command is used to create a test file and write to a specified file. This command won't run steps it creates. It's a **dry** run.

## Usage

```bash
/dry <file>
```

## Example usage

```bash
npx testdriverai@latest <filename.yaml>
> /dry click the 'log in' button
```

This command generates the steps to `click the 'log in' button` with an explanation and adds them to the current test file, without executing any command.

## Behavior

- TestDriver will create steps for the test file, writing them in the file.
- TestDriver will also show the reasoning and test steps in the CLI:

```bash
thinking...

    To click the 'log in' button, we need to identify and
    click on the text "Log in" visible in the screenshot.
    Here's how to accomplish this:

    commands:
      - command: hover-text
        text: Log in
        description: log in button in the code editor
        action: click

    ### Explanation:

    1. Click the 'Log in' Button: We use hover-text to locate and click on the "Log in" text visible in the code editor. This ensures the button is activated.
```

## Protips

- Ensure you run the `testdriverai` command with a valid file path before using `/dry`.
- Use descriptive filenames for your test files to make them easier to identify.
- Combine `/dry` with `/undo` to write test files without executing them.

## Notes

- The `/dry` command is ideal for writing out a series of steps before executing.
