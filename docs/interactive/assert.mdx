# Command: `/assert`

## Description
The `/assert` command ensures that a specific condition is true within your test. This is useful for verifying that tasks were completed successfully, just as a user would observe.

## Usage
```bash
/assert <criteria>
```

## Behavior
- The `/assert` command generates an assertion based on the specified criteria.
- TestDriver takes a screenshot and uses it to verify that the condition described in the `expect` field is true.
- If the condition isn't met, the test will fail and exit immediately.

## Example usage

### Basic assertion
```bash
/assert No error message is displayed
```
This generates the following command:
```yaml
- command: assert
  expect: There is no error message
```

### Asynchronous assertion
To speed up tests, use `async: true` to allow the test to continue without waiting for the assertion to pass:
```yaml
- command: assert
  expect: There is no error message
  async: true
```

## Protips
- Use assertions sparingly to avoid slowing down your tests.
- Combine `async: true` with assertions to improve test performance while still validating critical conditions.
- Ensure the `expect` field clearly describes the condition to avoid ambiguity.

## Gotchas
- If the condition in `expect` isn't met, the test will fail and exit immediately.
- Overusing assertions can make tests slower and harder to maintain.

## Notes
- The `/assert` command is ideal for validating key checkpoints in your test workflow.
- Use this command to ensure that critical tasks, such as error-free execution or successful navigation, are completed as expected.
