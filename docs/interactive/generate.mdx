# Command: `/generate`

## Description
The `/generate` command is an experimental feature that instructs TestDriver to create its own exploratory prompts. This command is used in the "Generate a Test Suite" demo and is designed to help automate the creation of exploratory test cases.

## Usage
```bash
/generate
```

## Behavior
- The `/generate` command analyzes the display and generates exploratory prompts for testing.
- Each exploratory test is saved as a simple Markdown file containing a list of steps.
- TestDriver generates 10 Markdown files every time the `/generate` command is called.
- The generated files are stored in the `./testdriver/generate/*.md` directory.

## Example output
Here's an example of a generated test file (`test-search-function.md`):
```markdown
1. Click on the search icon.
2. Type "real-time chat" into the search bar.
3. Assert that search results are relevant and displayed.
```

## Protips
- Use `/generate` to quickly create exploratory tests for regression testing or feature validation.
- Combine `/generate` with the GitHub Action to generate and run regression tests in parallel.
- Review the generated Markdown files and convert them into YAML test scripts for reuse.

## Gotchas
- The `/generate` command is experimental and may not always produce perfect test cases. Review and refine the generated tests as needed.
- Ensure the `./testdriver/generate/` directory exists and has write permissions.

## Notes
- The `/generate` command is ideal for automating the creation of exploratory test cases and generating regression tests.
- Generated tests can be merged into a regression test suite for continuous testing and validation.
