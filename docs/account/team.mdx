1. **Team Name**: The name of your team. This is used to identify your team in TestDriver.
2. **API Key**: Your API key is used to authenticate your requests to the TestDriver API. You can regenerate it if you suspect it has been compromised.
3. **Usage & Billing**: Monitor your usage and billing information. This includes your current plan, usage limits, and billing history.

4. **Replay Visibility**: Toggle whether your replays are public or private by default. This defaults to **private**.
