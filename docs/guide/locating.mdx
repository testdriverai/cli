TestDriver uses **visual understanding** to locate elements on the screen. Unlike traditional testing frameworks that rely on selectors or element IDs, TestDriver identifies elements based on their **visual appearance**. This guide explains how to describe elements effectively to ensure TestDriver can locate them accurately.

## KeypPrinciples for locating elements

1. **Describe the Element Visually**:
   - Focus on the **appearance** of the element, not its behavior or function.
   - Mention unique visual traits such as **text**, **color**, **size**, **position**, or **icon**.

2. **Avoid Behavioral Descriptions**:
   - don't describe what the element does (for example, "button that submits the form").
   - Instead, describe how it looks (for example, "blue button with the text 'Submit' in the bottom-right corner").

3. **Use Unique Identifiers**:
   - If the element has visible text, include it in the description.
   - For icons or images, describe their shape, color, or associated label.

4. **Leverage Visual Feedback**:
   - TestDriver will draw **yellow boxes** around detected elements during test execution.
   - Use this feedback to verify that the correct element is being targeted.

## Examples of effective descriptions

### 1. Buttons
- **Good**: "Blue button with the text 'Sign In' in the top-right corner."
- **Bad**: "Button that logs the user in."

### 2. Links
- **Good**: "Hyperlink with the text 'Learn More' in the footer."
- **Bad**: "Link that navigates to the About page."

### 3. Icons
- **Good**: "Magnifying glass icon next to the search bar."
- **Bad**: "Search icon that opens the search feature."

### 4. Input fields
- **Good**: "White input box labeled 'Email Address' above the password field."
- **Bad**: "Field where the user enters their email."

### 5. Images
- **Good**: "Company logo in the top-left corner, a blue circle with white text."
- **Bad**: "Logo that redirects to the homepage."

## How to write TestDriver commands

### Example: Locating a button

#### TestDriver command:

```yaml
- command: hover-text
  text: Sign In
  description: Blue button with the text 'Sign In' in the top-right corner
  action: click


```


---

### Example: Locating an icon

#### TestDriver command:

```yaml
- command: hover-image
  description: Magnifying glass icon next to the search bar
  action: click
```

---

### Example: Locating a link

#### TestDriver command:

```yaml
- command: hover-text
  text: Learn More
  description: Hyperlink with the text 'Learn More' in the footer
  action: click


```

## Debugging element detection

1. **Run the Test**:
   - Execute the test using TestDriver.
   - TestDriver will draw **yellow boxes** around detected elements.

2. **Verify the Correct Element**:
   - Ensure the yellow box highlights the intended element.
   - If the wrong element is highlighted, refine your description.

3. **Adjust the Description**:
   - Add more specific visual details (for example, color, position, associated text).
   - Avoid generic terms like "button" or "icon" without additional context.

---

## Best practices

1. **Be Specific**:
   - Include as many unique visual traits as possible to differentiate the element from others.

2. **Test Incrementally**:
   - Run tests after adding or modifying commands to verify element detection.

3. **Use Visual Feedback**:
   - Leverage the yellow boxes drawn by TestDriver to confirm the correct element is being targeted.

4. **Avoid Overloading Descriptions**:
   - Keep descriptions concise but detailed enough to uniquely identify the element.

By focusing on **visual descriptions** and leveraging TestDriver's feedback, you can accurately locate elements and create robust, reliable tests.
