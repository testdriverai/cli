# Waiting in TestDriver: Ensuring stability and reducing flakiness

Waiting is a critical feature in TestDriver that ensures tests are stable and reliable, even in dynamic or slow-loading environments. 

- Automatically adjusts to varying load times, reducing the need for hardcoded delays.
- Ensures that tests wait for dynamic elements to appear, reducing false negatives caused by incomplete rendering.
- By waiting for the screen and network to stabilize, `redraw` minimizes the risk of interacting with incomplete or incorrect elements.


## Summary of waiting features

| **Feature**          | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`redraw`(automatic)** | TestDriver automatically waits for UI changes and network activity to resolve. |
| **`wait-for-text`**   | Waits for specific text to appear on the screen.                                |
| **`wait-for-image`**  | Waits for a specific image or visual element to appear on the screen.           |

## Key waiting features in TestDriver

1. **Automatic Waiting with `redraw`**:
  - TestDriver automatically waits for the machine before moving to the next step.
  - This includes waiting for:
    - UI changes to complete.
    - Network activity to stabilize (for example, API calls).
  - Reduces the need for manual waits, making tests faster and less prone to flakiness.

2. **`wait-for-text` Command**:
  - Waits for specific text to appear on the screen.
  - Useful for validating dynamic content or ensuring that a page has fully loaded before proceeding.

3. **`wait-for-image` Command**:
  - Waits for a specific image or visual element to appear on the screen.
  - Ideal for verifying the presence of icons, logos, or other graphical elements.


## Commands for explicit waiting

### 1. **`wait-for-text`**

The `wait-for-text` command pauses the test until the specified text appears on the screen. This is particularly useful for dynamic content that takes time to load.

#### Syntax

```yaml
- command: wait-for-text
  text: <text to wait for>
  timeout: <time in milliseconds> # Optional, defaults to 5000ms
```

#### Example

```yaml
- command: wait-for-text
  text: Welcome, Test User!
  timeout: 10000
```

In this example, the test waits up to 10 seconds for the text "Welcome, Test User!" to appear.

### **`wait-for-image`**

The `wait-for-image` command pauses the test until the specified image or visual element appears on the screen.

#### Syntax:

```yaml
- command: wait-for-image
  description: <description of the image>
  timeout: <time in milliseconds> # Optional, defaults to 5000ms
```

#### Example:

```yaml
- command: wait-for-image
  description: Company logo in the top-left corner
  timeout: 8000
```

In this example, the test waits up to 8 seconds for the company logo to appear in the top-left corner.

## Automatic waiting with `redraw`

TestDriver's **`redraw` function** is a built-in mechanism that automatically waits for the screen to stabilize before proceeding to the next step. This includes:

1. **UI Changes**:
  - Waits for animations, transitions, or DOM updates to complete.
  - Ensures that the screen is fully rendered before interacting with elements.

2. **Network Stabilization**:
  - Waits for network activity (for example, API calls, AJAX requests) to finish.
  - Ensures that dynamic content is fully loaded before proceeding.

3. **Screen Stabilization**:
  - Continuously monitors the screen for changes and only moves forward when the screen is stable.

## Best practices for waiting

2. **Leverage Automatic Waiting**:
  - Rely on TestDriver's `redraw` function to handle most waiting scenarios automatically.

1. **Use Explicit Waiting for Dynamic Elements**:
  - Use `wait-for-text` or `wait-for-image` for elements that take time to load.

3. **Avoid Hardcoded Delays**:
  - Replace hardcoded `sleep` or `wait` commands with dynamic waiting commands to improve test reliability.

4. **Set Appropriate Timeouts**:
  - Use reasonable timeouts for explicit waiting commands to balance reliability and test execution time.

5. **Test Incrementally**:
  - Add waiting commands step-by-step to ensure each part of the workflow is stable.
