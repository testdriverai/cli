import GitignoreWarning from "/snippets/gitignore-warning.mdx";

The supported environment variables in TestDriver are:

|    Variable     |   Type    | Description                                                                              |
| :-------------: | :-------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TD_ANALYTICS`  | `boolean` | Send analytics to TestDriver servers. This helps provide feedback to inform our roadmap. |
|  `TD_API_ROOT`  | `string`  | Developer only. Set API root to another URL. For on-prem.                                |
|  `TD_API_KEY`   | `string`  | Set this to spawn VMs with TestDriver Pro.                                               |
| `TD_RESOLUTION` | `string`  | Change resolution when TD_VM is true. Format like `1280x1024`.                           |
|    `TD_TYPE`    | `string`  | Set the type of test to run. Can be `website`, `desktop`, or `mobile`. Not required.     |

## Example

```
TD_API_KEY=your_api_key
TD_RESOLUTION=1024x768
TD_TYPE=website
TD_WEBSITE=www.jeep.com
TD_ANALYTICS=true
```

In this example `.env` file, we're running a website test in a local Linux VM with a resolution of 1024x768. The terminal will be minimized, and the overlay won't be shown. Analytics will be sent to TestDriver servers.

## Using environment variables in deployed tests

When running tests in a deployed environment, you can set environment variables in the `env` section of your GitHub Actions workflow file. This allows you to customize the behavior of TestDriver based on the environment in which it's running. Setup any environment variables you plan to use in the deployed test in your `.env` file and add them as GitHub secrets.

<Tip>
  For more info on how to set up environment variables with GitHub Actions, see
  [Managing Secrets in GitHub Actions](/actions/secrets)
</Tip>

In this example, there is both a `TD_TEST_USERNAME` and `TD_TEST_PASSWORD` variables in the local `.env` file. This file is used to run tests locally and mask credentials used to log in to a website. When deployed, these variables are stored as secrets in GitHub and are passed to the TestDriver action when it runs.
