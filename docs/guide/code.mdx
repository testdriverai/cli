TestDriver allows you to execute custom **Node.js** scripts and shell scripts within your test workflows using the `exec` command. This feature, introduced in version `5.1.0`, enables you to integrate custom logic, such as generating one-time passwords (OTPs), hitting APIs, or performing other dynamic operations, directly into your tests.

## Key features

1. **Run Node.js Scripts**:

- Execute custom JavaScript code within your test steps.
- Use NPM modules to extend functionality.

2. **Dynamic Outputs**:

- Store the result of your script in a variable for use in subsequent steps.

3. **NPM Support**:

- Install and use NPM packages in your scripts.

## Updated example: One-time password (OTP) validator

This example demonstrates how to generate a one-time password (OTP) using the `totp-generator` NPM package and use it in a test.

### Test file: `testdriver/testdriver.yaml`

```yaml
version: 5.3.8
steps:
  - commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: pwsh
        linux: |
          npm install totp-generator
      - command: exec
        lang: js
        output: totp
        linux: |
          const { TOTP } = require("totp-generator");
          let otp = TOTP.generate("JBSWY3DPEB3W64TMMQQQ").otp;
          console.log(otp);
          result = otp;
      - command: type
        text: ${OUTPUT.totp}
```

## Additional details

- The `exec` command now takes a `lang` argument and supports different operating systems (`linux`, `mac`, and `windows`).
- Supported `lang` values are `js` or `shell`:
  - `js` code is executed in a Node.js VM on the host machine (your computer).
  - `shell` code is executed in the shell on the runner.
- Code specified in `linux`, `mac`, and `windows` is executed based on the platform of the runner machine.

## Protips

- Always assign the output of your script to the `result` variable.
- Ensure all required NPM packages are installed locally and in the `prerun` script when using GitHub Actions.
- The script runs in the same context as the calling process and uses Node.js's [VM module](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html) internally.
